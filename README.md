# ðŸŽ¤ Week08 Bootcamp2019a Project: Wu-Tang Name Generator

### Goal: Create a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. Present the user with 5 survey questions and based on those answers randomly generate their name. The name doesn't have to be exact names, but Wu-Tang sounding-ish names. Ex: Childish Gambino (who actually got his name from a Wu-Tang name generator).

### Process:

<ol>
  <li>Me and my pall Ludjy?  We destroyed this project.  The way the ideas flowed out from our noggins was really a sight to see, especially for relatively new coders.</li>
  <li>The goal was to create and boy did we create.<li>
  <li>After making our survey questions (I used first name, last name, favorite color and animal, and last shag (heh), we invented ourselves a point system server-side in order to keep track of .</li>
  <li>Based on whatever the user was answering, the client side JS would read, assign a point value to the given response and send that back to the server in order to access a name and song from on of five JSON objects that contained that data.</li>
   <li>The hardest part, really was trying to get the data to return from the JavaScript onto the HTML.</li>
  <li>After we found said data, it was promptly displayed in the HTML for our new Wutang Clan member to see.</li> 

<p>Overall, I am so happy with how quickly and soundly it all came together  It wasn't really anything too spectacular.  It just satisfied the needs of the project.  Get 'er done, as they say..</p>

<ul>
  <li>I completed the challenge: | 5 <em>Crushed it.</em></li>
  <li>I feel good about my code: | 5 <em>Airtight, solid, righteous.  I loved this one.  Shout out to Ludjy again.  Big brain, big heart.</em></li>
</ul>
